Hello there ðŸ‘‹ my name is Ryan Waldrop, and I am studying to gain employment in the Data/IT field. I currently reside in Mississippi and am self-employed at the moment. My interests are sort of all over the place, but a few are:
- ðŸŽ® Gaming
- ðŸ¥Ž Tennis
- ðŸŽº Trumpet

Iâ€™m currently enrolled at Western Governor's University in their Cloud Computing b.s. degree with an expected graduation date of May-August 2027. I hope to gain meaningful knowledge of IT and the cloud during my studies. In addition to this, I have also been self-studying SQL, Tableau, and Excel, I also have an understanding of coding in Java.
I would categorize my current understanding of each of them as follows:
- SQL Upper-Intermediate
  - query writing including but not limited to: CTE's substrings, aggregate functions, filtering with WHERE and Grouping data, as well as joins.
- Tableau Lower-Intermediate
  - Capable of creating a variety of eye-catching visualizations based on data obtained from SQL/Excel files
- Excel Intermediate
  - Ability to use pivot tables, V and X Lookups, apply conditional formatting, utilize various functions and formulas, and create simple visualizations within Excel
- Java Upper-Intermediate
  - Familiarity with loops, if statements, methods, recursion, and various data structures like arrays, lists, and hash tables.


I have so much that I wish to learn and understand, it's a bit daunting to think about the amount of work that lies ahead, but it's even more frightening to remain stagnant in life. As for my goals, I plan to build up my skills mentioned above and more to enter the Data/IT field in the future. Thank you so much for stopping by!

I will be including CompTIA and AWS/Azure certifications that I earn from WGU's B.S. program down below as I earn them:
